This repository contains the code (in .py file) that was used to analyse the accuracy of the pre-operative algorithm that Finnish Meteorological Institute is applying. The Cb detection with the algorithm is compared with METAR observations (METARs are regarded as ground turth in this study). The dataset that is used is from June, July and August from years 2016-2020.
